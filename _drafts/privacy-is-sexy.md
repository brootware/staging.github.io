## Introduction

As a technology professional, I am agnostic when it comes to operating systems. The only thing I am concerned about is how the hardware and tools I use will help me be productive and at the same time protect my data and privacy in an increasingly surveillent society.

## Finding any existing open source projects

So I have both Windows and MacOS platforms running on my devices and virtual machines that I will need to do security and privacy hardening on personally. Just like any other tech professional with a github account, I searched for any existing tools that I could use to not reinvent the wheel. Usually a lot of time are lost and progression is slow if you do not know [How to stand on shoulders of giant](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-stand-on-shoulders-16e8cfbc127b/). A recommended read by Quincy Larson, freecodecamp's founder.

## A privacy.sexy web app

After searching around, I come across a project called [privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy). A web application with really nice user interface for normal everyday users. The users can go to the web page, find security features explained in plain english that they can turn on using batch (for Windows) and bash (for MacOs) scripts.

## Turning it into cli for Mac and Windows

## Challenges faced

For windows, the web app is using batch. Rewriting them in powershell will take a lot of time.

## How they're resolved

## Conclusion
