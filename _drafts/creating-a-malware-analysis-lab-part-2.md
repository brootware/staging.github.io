## Introduction

This is the continuation of part 1: creating a malware analysis lab. To recap in part 1 we setup a flare vm by mandiant and create an image as a vagrant box to be uploaded to vagrant cloud for distribution. A vagrantfile is also created to configure and spin up the VM locally with recommended specifications.

In this part, we will explore:

1. Setting up a flare vm on Azure.
2. Create an image using Azure image builder, a cloud native feature of Azure.
3. Publish the image into Azure compute gallery for distribution within your organization.
